### Modality-specific effects of perceptual load in multimedia processing 
**Fisher, J.T.**, Hopp, F.R., & Weber, R. (2019) <br>
*Media & Communication*

Digital media are sensory-rich, multimodal, and often highly interactive. An extensive collection of theories and models within the ﬁeld of media psychology assume the multimodal nature of media stimuli, yet there is current ambiguity as to the independent contributions of visual and auditory content to message complexity and to resource availability in the human processing system. In this manuscript, we argue that explicating the concepts of perceptual and cognitive load can create progress toward a deeper understanding of modality-speciﬁc effects in media processing. In addition, we report ﬁndings from an experiment showing that perceptual load leads to modality-speciﬁc reductions in resource availability, whereas cognitive load leads to a modality-general reduction in resource availability. We conclude with a brief discussion regarding the critical importance of separating modality-speciﬁc forms of load in an increasingly multisensory media environment.

### iCoRe: The GDELT interface for the advancement of communication research 
Hopp. F.R., Schaffer, J., **Fisher, J.T.**, Cornell, D., & Weber, R. (2019) <br>
*Computational Communication Research*

This article introduces the interface for communication research (iCoRe) to access, explore, and analyze the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT; Leetaru &; Schrodt, 2013). GDELT provides a vast, open source, and constantly updated repository of online news and event metadata collected from tens of thousands of news outlets around the world. Despite GDELT’s promise for advancing communication science, its massive scale and complex data structures have hindered efforts of communication scholars aiming to access and analyze GDELT. We thus developed iCoRe, an easy-to-use web interface that (a) provides fast access to the data available in GDELT, (b) shapes and processes GDELT for theory-driven applications within communication research, and (c) enables replicability through transparent query and analysis protocols. After providing an overview of how GDELT’s data pertain to addressing communication research questions, we provide a tutorial of utilizing iCoRe across three theory-driven case studies. We conclude this article with a discussion and outlook of iCoRe’s future potential to advance communication research.

### The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing: taking stock of the past
**Fisher, J.T.**, Keene, J.R., Huskey, R., & Weber, R. (2018) <br>
*Annals of the International Communication Association*

In the 15 years since its inception, the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) has contributed to understanding regarding the dynamics of message processing in a variety of domains. In this manuscript we outline the foundations and assumptions of the LC4MP, discussing salient research from biology, cognitive psychology, and communication upon which the model is built. We then conduct a systematic review of the LC4MP literature with a focus on three primary domains: cognitive load, motivated processing, and memory. In a companion piece (Fisher, Huskey, Keene, &; Weber, 2018) we look to the future of the model, incorporating recent findings from communication and cognate fields to inform an updated suite of predictions.

In a companion piece (Fisher, Keene, Huskey, &; Weber, 2018), we reviewed the foundations and current state of the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP). In this manuscript we return to the three areas investigated in our review: cognitive load, motivation, and memory. In each domain, we: (a) outline areas in which the LC4MP has produced unexpected or ambiguous findings; (b) look broadly at literature from biology, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience to inform and clarify definitions of key terms; (c) develop an updated, cohesive framework of assumptions and predictions of the LC4MP; and (d) propose a roadmap for testing the proposed framework. We conclude with a discussion of the LC4MP's continued relevance for understanding dynamic, interactive, multimodal communication phenomena.

### Taking messages into the magnet: method-theory synergy in communication neuroscience
Weber, R., **Fisher, J.T.**, Hopp, F.R., & Lonergan, C. (2018) <br>
*Communication Monographs*

Brain imaging techniques within communication research have rapidly expanded in popularity in recent years, driven by an increase in access to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology and by theoretical developments within the field. In this manuscript, we present an overview of research from within communication and cognate disciplines that has leveraged insights from fMRI research to "push the envelope," demonstrating a synergy between methodological and theoretical progress. In addition, we provide a review of fMRI technology, methodology, and theoretical considerations, focusing on recent developments in the cognitive and brain sciences that are of special relevance to communication scholars. Finally, we provide a series of practical recommendations and resources for communication scholars interested in conducting fMRI studies.
