### The extended moral foundations dictionary (eMFD): Development and applications of a crowd-sourced approach to extracting moral intuitions from text 
Hopp, F.R., **Fisher, J.T.**, Cornell, D., Huskey, R., & Weber, R. <br>
*Behaviour Research Methods* • 2020

Moral  intuitions  are  a  central  motivator  in  human  behavior.  Recent  work  highlights  the  importance  of moral intuitions for understanding a wide range of issues ranging from online radicalization to vaccine hesitancy.  Extracting  and  analyzing  moral  content  in  messages,  narratives,  and  other  forms  of  public discourse  is  a  critical  step  toward  understanding  how  the  psychological  influence  of  moral  judgments unfolds  at  a  global  scale.  Extant  approaches  for  extracting  moral  content  are  limited  in  their  ability  tocapture  the  intuitive  nature  of  moral  sensibilities,  constraining  their  usefulness  for  understanding  and predicting  human  moral  behavior.  Here  we  introduce  the  extended  Moral  Foundations  Dictionary (eMFD),  a  dictionary-based  tool  for  extracting  moral  content  from  textual  corpora.  The  eMFD,  unlike previous methods, is constructed from text annotations generated by a large sample of human coders. We demonstrate that the eMFD outperforms existing approaches in a variety of domains. We anticipate that the  eMFDwill  contribute  to  advance  the  study  of  moral  intuitions  and  their  influence  on  social, psychological, and communicative processes. _Publisher link coming soon_.

### Dynamic transactions between news frames and sociopolitical events: An integrative, hidden Markov model approach 
Hopp, F.R., **Fisher, J.T.**, & Weber, R. <br>
*Journal of Communication* • 2020

A central goal of news research is to understand the interplay between news coverage and sociopolitical events. Although a great deal of work has elucidated how events drive news coverage, and how in turn news coverage influences societal outcomes, integrative systems-level models of the reciprocal interchanges between these two processes are sparse. Herein, we present a macro-scale investigation of the dynamic transactions between news frames and events using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), focusing on morally-charged news frames and sociopolitical events. Using 3,501,141 news records discussing 504,759 unique events, we demonstrate that sequences of frames and events can be characterized in terms of "hidden states" containing distinct moral frame and event relationships, and that these “hidden states” can forecast future news frames and events. This work serves to construct a path toward the integrated study of the news-event cycle across multiple research domains.

### Video game violence and interactivity: Effect or equivalence?
Weber, R., Behr, K.-M. **Fisher, J.T.**, Lonergan. C., & Quebral, C. <br>
*Journal of Communication* • 2020

The effect of exposure to violent video game content on aggression is intensely debated. Meta-analyses have produced widely varying estimates as to the effect (or non-effect) of violent video games on subsequent aggressive thoughts and behaviors. Recent work suggests that interactivity and player skill may play key roles in moderating the effects of violent content in video games on aggression. This study investigates the effects of violence, interactivity, and player skill on mild aggressive behavior using a custom-developed first-person shooter game allowing for high levels of experimental control. We conduct effect and equivalence tests with effect size assumptions drawn from prominent meta-analyses in the video game violence literature, finding that aggressive behavior following violent video game play is statistically equivalent to that observed following non-violent game play. We also observe an interaction between violent game content, player skill, and interactivity. When player skill matched the interactivity of the game, violent content led to an increase in aggressive behavior, whereas when player skill did not match the interactivity of the game, violent content decreased aggressive behavior. This interaction is probed using a multiverse analysis incorporating both classical significance testing and Bayesian analyses.

Kümpel, A.S., Lukito, J., Bier, L.M., Zhang, R., Johnson, B.K., Huskey, R., Schneider, F.M., Breuer, J., Parry, D.A., Vermeulen, I., **Fisher, J.T.** Banks, J., Weber, R., Ellis, D., Smits, T., Ivory, J.D., Trepte, S., McEwan, B., Rinke, E.M., Neubaum, G., Winter, S., Carpenter, C.J., Krämer, N., Utz, S., Unkel, J., Wang, X., Davidson, B.I., Kim, N., Won, A.S., Domahidi, E., Lewis, N.A., de Vreese, C. <br>
*Journal of Communication* • 2020

In the last 10 years, many canonical findings in the social sciences appear unreliable. This so-called “replication crisis” has spurred calls for open science practices, which aim to increase the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings. Communication research is subject to many of the same challenges that have caused low replicability in other fields. As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication, which includes the following seven suggestions: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2) preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5) foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. Although in our agenda we focus mostly on quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research. We conclude by discussing potential objections and concerns associated with open science practices.

### Modality-specific effects of perceptual load in multimedia processing 
**Fisher, J.T.**, Hopp, F.R., & Weber, R. <br>
*Media & Communication* • 2019

Digital media are sensory-rich, multimodal, and often highly interactive. An extensive collection of theories and models within the ﬁeld of media psychology assume the multimodal nature of media stimuli, yet there is current ambiguity as to the independent contributions of visual and auditory content to message complexity and to resource availability in the human processing system. In this manuscript, we argue that explicating the concepts of perceptual and cognitive load can create progress toward a deeper understanding of modality-speciﬁc effects in media processing. In addition, we report ﬁndings from an experiment showing that perceptual load leads to modality-speciﬁc reductions in resource availability, whereas cognitive load leads to a modality-general reduction in resource availability. We conclude with a brief discussion regarding the critical importance of separating modality-speciﬁc forms of load in an increasingly multisensory media environment.

### iCoRe: The GDELT interface for the advancement of communication research 
Hopp. F.R., Schaffer, J., **Fisher, J.T.**, Cornell, D., & Weber, R. <br>
*Computational Communication Research* • 2019

This article introduces the interface for communication research (iCoRe) to access, explore, and analyze the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT; Leetaru &; Schrodt, 2013). GDELT provides a vast, open source, and constantly updated repository of online news and event metadata collected from tens of thousands of news outlets around the world. Despite GDELT’s promise for advancing communication science, its massive scale and complex data structures have hindered efforts of communication scholars aiming to access and analyze GDELT. We thus developed iCoRe, an easy-to-use web interface that (a) provides fast access to the data available in GDELT, (b) shapes and processes GDELT for theory-driven applications within communication research, and (c) enables replicability through transparent query and analysis protocols. After providing an overview of how GDELT’s data pertain to addressing communication research questions, we provide a tutorial of utilizing iCoRe across three theory-driven case studies. We conclude this article with a discussion and outlook of iCoRe’s future potential to advance communication research.

### The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing: taking stock of the past
**Fisher, J.T.**, Keene, J.R., Huskey, R., & Weber, R.  <br>
*Annals of the International Communication Association* • 2018

In the 15 years since its inception, the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP) has contributed to understanding regarding the dynamics of message processing in a variety of domains. In this manuscript we outline the foundations and assumptions of the LC4MP, discussing salient research from biology, cognitive psychology, and communication upon which the model is built. We then conduct a systematic review of the LC4MP literature with a focus on three primary domains: cognitive load, motivated processing, and memory. In a companion piece (Fisher, Huskey, Keene, &; Weber, 2018) we look to the future of the model, incorporating recent findings from communication and cognate fields to inform an updated suite of predictions.

### The limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing: looking to the future.
**Fisher, J.T.**, Huskey, R., Keene, J.R., & Weber, R. <br>
*Annals of the International Communication Association* • 2018 <br>
**Distinguished Article Award, NCA Social Cognition Division**

In a companion piece (Fisher, Keene, Huskey, &; Weber, 2018), we reviewed the foundations and current state of the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP). In this manuscript we return to the three areas investigated in our review: cognitive load, motivation, and memory. In each domain, we: (a) outline areas in which the LC4MP has produced unexpected or ambiguous findings; (b) look broadly at literature from biology, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience to inform and clarify definitions of key terms; (c) develop an updated, cohesive framework of assumptions and predictions of the LC4MP; and (d) propose a roadmap for testing the proposed framework. We conclude with a discussion of the LC4MP's continued relevance for understanding dynamic, interactive, multimodal communication phenomena.

### Taking messages into the magnet: method-theory synergy in communication neuroscience
Weber, R., **Fisher, J.T.**, Hopp, F.R., & Lonergan, C. <br>
*Communication Monographs* • 2018

Brain imaging techniques within communication research have rapidly expanded in popularity in recent years, driven by an increase in access to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology and by theoretical developments within the field. In this manuscript, we present an overview of research from within communication and cognate disciplines that has leveraged insights from fMRI research to "push the envelope," demonstrating a synergy between methodological and theoretical progress. In addition, we provide a review of fMRI technology, methodology, and theoretical considerations, focusing on recent developments in the cognitive and brain sciences that are of special relevance to communication scholars. Finally, we provide a series of practical recommendations and resources for communication scholars interested in conducting fMRI studies.
